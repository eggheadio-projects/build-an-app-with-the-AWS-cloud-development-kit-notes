## About üîç

This repo contains notes from [Tomasz ≈Åakomy](https://twitter.com/tlakomy)'s Egghead Collection [Build an App with the AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://egghead.io/lessons/aws-build-and-deploy-a-sample-aws-cloud-development-kit-stack-to-aws).

These notes contain the same structure as the transcriptions, along with additional rewrites, links to resources, and personal takes on the lesson. Feel free to submit additions to these notes, but please don't remove anything (unless we messed up or misunderstood something).

Generally, there is one document for each lesson in the course. If there are related lessons, the notes will be in the same document.

## Course Objective üí™

You've probably already heard of cloud computing, `aws`, `lambda` functions, `s3` buckets, but have no idea what those things are. Good news! This course serve as an introduction to all of these things and more!

You'll learn how to deploy a `cdk` template, write your first `lambda` function, initialize a new `s3` bucket to store your assets, save things in a NoSQL database called `dynamoDB`, connect a `react` application to your backend and deploy all of it to a CDN!

By the end of the course you'll not only have a good understanding of (some of) `aws` features, you'll also have a working application deployed live on the internet.
